//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree: 
BFS

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
DFS will take long time. So, BFS

//If the tree is very wide: 
DFS (BFS needs much memory)

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree: 
DFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes: 
DFS

//Finding the shortest path: 
BFS
